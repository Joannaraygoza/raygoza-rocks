In December 2019 I decided I wanted to become a self-taught programmer. I did some research and
tried out various learning tools including Django Girls, but realized I needed to learn a base language before learning Django.
I settled on Python as my base language and did the Coursera specialization entitled Python 3 Programming Specialization; I finished that in April 2020.
It's now June 2020 and I'm working on learning more Python from various sources.
I have also been working through the Django Girls tutorial since I now have the base knowledge.
