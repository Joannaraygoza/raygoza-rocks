In December 2019 I decided I wanted to become a self-taught programmer. I did some research and
tried out various learning tools including Django Girls, but realized I needed to learn a base language.
I settled on Python as my base language and did the Coursera specialization; finished that in April 2020.
It's now April 2020 and I'm working on figuring out Github.
I plan to go back to working on the Django Girls tutorial since I now have the base knowledge.
